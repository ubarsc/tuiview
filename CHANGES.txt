* Use setuptools and pip and create entrypoints for command line programs
* Add support for keywords in the vectorrasterizer C extension
* Release the GIL for long running operations in the vectorrasterizer C extension
* Support for signed 8 bit images (introduced in GDAL 3.7)
* Cope with changed import lib name on Windows in GDAL 3.6

Version 1.2.10 (2022-06-22)
---------------------------

* Support for 64 bit int images (introduced in GDAL 3.5)
* Improvements to vectorrasterizer.c, including new rasterizeWKB() C function
* New main window icon

Version 1.2.9 (2022-02-17)
--------------------------

* Fixes for plotwidget under Python 3.10
* Remove Python 2 support
* Tweak source so flake8 is happy (and add CI run to check this on github)
* Don't install LICENSE.txt and CHANGES.txt
* Remove dependency on the deprecated distutils module
* Change plugin mechanism to use importlib instead of the deprecated imp module

Version 1.2.8 (2021-09-21)
--------------------------

* Add the ability to "rollover" when running through a timeseries and start again.

* When adding vectors from the command line, only show layer dialog once
* Add --vectorlayer and --vectorsql command line options to prevent vector layer dialog being shown
* Include all colorbrewer2.org ramps
* Allow float columns to be used as lookups into surrogate colour tables (not just restricted to integers)
