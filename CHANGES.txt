* Save Query Window size/location plus which screen in viewer state

Version 1.2.11 (2022-12-22)
---------------------------

* Fixes for numpy 1.24.0
* Use setuptools and pip and create entrypoints for command line programs
* Add support for keywords in the vectorrasterizer C extension

Version 1.2.9 (2022-02-17)
--------------------------

* Fixes for plotwidget under Python 3.10
