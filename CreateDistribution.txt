How to create a distribution of TuiView. 

1. Ensure that you have fetched and committed everything which needs to go in.
2. Change the version number in the tuiview/__init__.py. Version number
   is of the form a.b.c, as discussed below. Also update CHANGES.txt.
   DON'T FORGET TO COMMIT THIS, BEFORE THE NEXT STEP!!!!
3. Push the changes to github with "git push". 
4. Check out a clean copy of the repository into /tmp or
   somewhere similar and 'cd' into it.
5. Create the distribution tarball, using
       python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip
   This creates both a tar.gz and a zip, under a subdirectory called dist
   This also ensures that the .bat files needed on Windows are included
   when creating the tarball on Linux.
6. Create checksums of each of these, e.g.
       sha256sum tuiview-1.2.3.tar.gz > tuiview-1.2.3.tar.gz.sha256
       sha256sum tuiview-1.2.3.zip > tuiview-1.2.3.zip.sha256
7. Go to the https://github.com/ubarsc/tuiview/releases page, and create a 
   new release by pressing "Draft a new release". 
   You should fill in the following:
       Tag version: tuiview-A.B.C
       Release Title: Version A.B.C
       Upload files: Add the tar.gz and zip files, and their sha256 checksum files. 
       Click "Publish release"
       


Version Numbers.
The TuiView version number is structured as A.B.C. We follow the conventions 
outlined in Semantic Versioning [https://semver.org]
- The A number should change for major alterations, most particularly those 
  which break backward compatability, or which involve major restructuring of 
  code or data structures. 
- The B number should change for introduction of significant new features
- The C number should change for bug fixes or very minor changes.
