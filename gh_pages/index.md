- Querying and plotting of raster values
- Overlaying and querying of vector layers
- Ability to stretch data for viewing in a number of ways, and ability to set a default stretch for each type of file
- Saving and loading of stretch information into text or image files
- Profile tool
- Display of raster attribute tables and highlighting of rows for queried pixel
- Selection of raster attribute table rows based on a query, or through geographical selection
- Creation of new attribute table columns and updating of columns
- Flicker tool
