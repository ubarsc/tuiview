This document describes the installation of TuiView from source. 
It is recommended to use pre-built packages where available, for
example from conda-forge.

Unpacking The Source
--------------------

To install python-fmask from the source code bundle, use the following commands
First unpack the bundle. For the tar.gz file, this would be 
    tar xfz TuiView-1.2.10.tar.gz
For the zip file this would be
    unzip -q TuiView-1.2.10.zip
    
Prerequisites
-------------
    
To install TuiView you will need the following packages installed:

  * Python 3.6 or later
  * PyQt5
  * numpy
  * GDAL with Python Bindings and headers
  * A C compiler that is compatible with your Python installation.
     (Windows users may wish to look at https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers
      for further explanation).
  
On Windows you will need to set the environment variable "GDAL_ROOT"
to the root of your GDAL installation. On Unix this is inferred
by running the "gdal-config" command during installation.

Installation
------------

Run the command:
  pip install .
  
If you wish to install in a non-default location, use
  pip install . --prefix=/yourChosenDirectory

If installed in a non-default location, you will then need to ensure that the 
right environment variables are set. For simple bash syntax, this would be 
something like:
    export PATH="/yourChosenDirectory/bin:$PATH"
    export PYTHONPATH="/yourChosenDirectory/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH"
    
Note that the pythonX.X sub-directory needs to match your version of python.
